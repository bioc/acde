        Genes

Description: This package provides a multivariate inferential analysis
        method for detecting differentially expressed genes in gene
        expression data. It uses artificial components, close to the
        data's principal components but with an exact interpretation in
        terms of differential genetic expression, to identify
        differentially expressed genes while controlling the false
        discovery rate (FDR). The methods on this package are described
        in the vignette or in the article 'Multivariate Method for
        Inferential Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes in
        Gene Expression Experiments' by J. P. Acosta, L. Lopez-Kleine
        and S. Restrepo (2015, pending publication).
